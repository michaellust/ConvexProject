# ConvexProject
Repository for Network Congestion Project Code for Convex Optimization at UNCC FALL 2021.
There are three versions of this project. All of the versions/implementations are made in Jupyter Notebook Python extension. Only the final implementation includes a simple .py
file and a .ipynb to make it easier for more people to use and see. That is why there is two Final Implementation files. Simply download the code and run for each.
